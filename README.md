# Health Hub

This projects aims at providing  a health-check application to the user. Using this application, the user can check:


~ If the user has diabetes

~ User's overall body performance 

~ If the user has heart disease 

~ User's obesity rate 


We have used Artificial Neural Network(ANN), K-Nearest Neighbour(KNN) with Hypermeter tuning models for predicting the results.
The ML models for each is attached in the repository.

Obesity_Model.py

Heart_Disease_Model.py

Diabetes_Model.py

Body_Performance.py


Health_Hub.py contains the entire program


Once the user inputs their information, the ML model searches from a dataset and displays the result.


Datasets used in this application in taken from kaggle. The datasets used in this program has been attached in the repository herewith. 


Python's tkinter GUI is used in creating the frontend part of this application.
The developed application can be converted into an executable file.

The working model and output screenshots are attached in this repository as Output.jpg-Output_9.jpg
