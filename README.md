# Health Hub

This projects aims at providing  a health-check application to the user. Using this application, the user can check:
~ If the user has diabetes
~ User's overall body performance 
~ If the user has heart disease 
~ User's obesity rate 

We have used Machine Learning models for predicting the results.
Once the user inputs their information, the ML model searches from a dataset and displays the result.

Datasets used in this application in taken from kaggle. 

Python's tkinter GUI is used in creating the frontend part of this application.
